Computers were invented in the English speaking world; from the works of Babbage, to the developments of Turing, and the first big computer selling companies in the USA.  The word <em style="color:#060">computer</em> comes from the verb <em style="color:#060">to compute</em> as in to perform mathematical computations.  The cognate verb in French <em style="color:#009">computer</em> has a similar meaning but the derived word <em style="color:#009">computateur</em> was already used for a clerk who works with numbers.  So marketers in France used another word <em style="color:#009">ordenateur</em>, from verb <em style="color:#009">ordener</em><em style="color:#060">: to ordain, to sort</em>.

Technically that's what any Turing machine, including digital computers do: they sort.  Arithmetical operations within the guts of the processor of a digital computer is actually a labor of sorting bits.  Our brains are also in the business of sorting things, but in a way different than digital computers.  Much of what our brains do is to search for patterns in new information, and establish categories and relationships with information in our memory.  Then, that new information might be storage to make new memories.
